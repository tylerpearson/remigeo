Work in progress. The current version is up on staging server -- if you have any interest playing around with it, feel free to message me.

The inital part of this was built over 24 hours during the [American Underground Hackathon](http://www.auhackathon.com/) in Durham on March 3-4 (by just me!).

To be added:
- see notes by location
- ability to hide messages
- better looking/functioning website
- switch away from Google Maps to Mapbox
- customized response for Foursquare push messages
- clean up sleep-dreprived crappy code
- *Long term* iOS app with Rubymotion to eliminate dependency on Foursquare checkins for message notifications
